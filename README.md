# Active-Directory-Project-Home-Lab-
 I'll guide you through the steps of setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux &amp; Atomic Red Team. Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help you detect them in the future.
